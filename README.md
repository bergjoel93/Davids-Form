# webpack-starter

Frontend environment for building JavaScript applications.

## things left to do

- style the Saved tab better. Add buttons, make the UI better by having a clickable button title that will produce a popup modal with a text area inside. Then make it so if you click outside it will close.

- change the local storage so that it's an array and not individual objects being saved to local.

- make it print the object prettier. Make it print it as a list.

- add a delete button so that the data objects can be deleted.

- make everything on the form UI smaller.

- Add the persisten notes. this will be a new object that is saved to local storage separtely.
